# HTML Code Editor

Code Editor allows to view and edit plain HTML code. [codemirror](https://codemirror.net/) is used for this purpose.

In order for the code editor to work. You must install codemirror as a `peerDependency`

```bash
npm install codemirror --save

#or

yarn add codemirror
```

Then import the CodeMirror's stylesheet into your app.

```bash
node_modules/codemirror/lib/codemirror.css
```
